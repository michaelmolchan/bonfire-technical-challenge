# Bonfire Technical Challenge

We have a small technical challenge for candidates interested in the position. The challenge is to take the attached photoshop document and turn it into a single working web page. You can build in any way that you want and using any framework that you want (or no framework at all). The links on the page don’t need to go anywhere so you can set the href attribute to “#”.

## Requirements

1.  The final page should work across all screen sizes from a full width desktop screen to a 320px wide phone.
2.  The final page should work across modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
3.  The tabs that say “all”, “even”, and “odd” should show/hide the appropriate boxes below. It should start off with “all” selected and all boxes showing.
4.  We’ve included an example of what the boxes should look like when the user hovers over one.

## Bonus Points

-  Use of HTML5 and CSS3 over older techniques
-  Page Speed Optimization
-  SEO Considerations

And that’s it. When you’re done either zip up your folder and email it over or put it on Github and share the link with us. If you have any questions feel free to reach out. Looking forward to hearing from you.
